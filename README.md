# SQL-Experience
The SQL Experience is an assigned project for the Introduction to Database Systems course at the University of Houston. The final project consisted of 3 sub-assignments. Each assignment contained a list of tasks which should be accomplished by using one or a combination of multiple SQL statements.

## What the File is
Each file is separated by the number corresponding to each assignment number. I unfortunately do not have the permission yet to post the assignment questions. But that will explain the few lines that say "-----3". After the assignment number, the actual statement will take up the next few lines and at the very end will be the output of the code.

## Viewing the Code
When you download the file, it will download as a .lst. Right-click the file and depending on your OS, open the file with whatever the basic text editing software is. I highly recommend opening the .lst files using a word processing software such as Microsoft Word or the Mac OS Pages.
